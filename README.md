# Interposcatter

Interposcatter allows you to plot one dependent variable of a time series vs. another. 

To use it, you must have at least two time series plotted (a data frame with first field time, second field numeric). 

More documentation will be written in the future, maybe. 

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
